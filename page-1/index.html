        <h2>GRADIENTS</h2>
        <h3>The colorful design trend aiming to soothe these anxious times</h3>

        <p2>Here’s why The Daily, Coachella, and Facebook all use backgrounds that look like a sunset.</p2>

        <details class="questions" id="question-1">
            <summary>What it is:</summary>
            <div>
                <p>A digital or print effect where one color fades into another. Typically rendered in soft or pastel
                    tones.

            <summary>Where it is:</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Gradients are seemingly everywhere in media and marketing. They are part of a suite of Facebook
                    status backdrops introduced in 2017 and the branding for the New York Times’ popular podcast The
                    Daily, which displays a yellow to blue gradient.

                    Gradients have taken over Coachella’s app and website (if you watch carefully, the colors shift).
                    Ally’s billboard in A Star Is Born is a full-on gradient, and so was the branding for the Oscars
                    ceremony that recognized Lady Gaga.

                    On Instagram, they provide a product backdrop for popular Korean beauty brand Glow, and have been
                    embraced by indie magazines Gossamer and Anxy both designed by Berkeley studio Anagraph.

        <details class="questions" id="question-3">
            <summary>Why you’r seeing it:</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Gradients are the confluence of three different trends: Light and Space art, vaporwave, and bisexual
                    lighting.

                    In the art and design world, Light and Space developed in the 1960s and ’70s has been experiencing a
                    revival thanks to its Instagramability. Light and Space pioneer James Turrell has been embraced by
                    celebrities like Beyoncé, Drake, and Kanye West. Drake’s Hotline Bling video was inspired by
                    Turrell’s light-infused rooms called Ganzfelds. The Kardashian-Jenner-West crew posted an Instagram
                    in front of one of Turrell’s works in Los Angeles. (I was yelled at by security for taking a picture
                    there but it’s fine.)
